### Welcome to dev2dev jobs, 

which brings a breath of fresh air to the recruitment of developers by developers (and possibly technical recruiters). 

It turns the traditional one-way HR process into a circular, developer-to-developer one.

You need to be a developer with a GitHub account in order to sign up to dev2dev jobs. After you sign up with your GitHub account, youâ€™ll be able to connect with your GitHub network in the app.

Once youâ€™re in, youâ€™ll be able to make these actions:

### Post jobs 
You can create new jobs and spread them to your contacts you choose. Later you can view the nominees for your posted jobs.

### Share jobs
You can spread jobs again that are spread to you, to developers who you think can share the jobs with the right people.

### Nominate contacts
You can nominate candidates for jobs that are spread to you. The nominees can accept or decline the jobs.

### Hire the one
You will be able to view the nominees that think they are a good fit for your job. You can choose the best candidate from the list, and contact them via email.

After you post a job, you can expect it to spread like a wildfire across your network.

## You can also:

### View the jobs youâ€™re involved

You can follow the jobs that you posted, you are nominated for, or are spread to you. Youâ€™ll be able to view when there is any activity regarding you.

### Check out the tech stack of nominees 

Every developer will have a personal page with their short bio and tech stack. Minimal yet effective.

### Visit individual pages of tech stacks (coming soon)
Whether you are a newbie or an experienced developer, open the door for new explorations within the app.

Donâ€™t miss the chance to be in the front lines of this game-changing process!
